# XP Values
1. Communication
Throughout the project, our team prioritized clear and effective communication. We established a routine of holding weekly virtual meetings every Friday, ensuring that all team members were up-to-date with the project's progress and any emerging challenges. In these sessions, we encourage open dialogue, allowing each team member to voice their ideas and concerns. This consistent communication not only helped in resolving issues promptly but also fostered a collaborative environment where feedback was actively sought and valued. Additionally, we used a dedicated Discord channel for daily updates and quick queries, ensuring continuous and accessible communication among all team members.
2. Respect
Our team culture was deeply rooted in mutual respect and understanding. We acknowledged and appreciated the diverse skill sets and perspectives each member brought to the table. In decision-making processes, we ensured that everyone's viewpoints were heard and considered before reaching a consensus. This inclusive approach not only strengthened our team dynamics but also enhanced our project outcomes. Furthermore, we respected each other's time and commitments by adhering to agreed deadlines and providing ample notice for any required changes. This level of respect cultivated a positive and supportive work environment, enabling us to work harmoniously and efficiently towards our common goals.
3. Simplicity
From the onset of the MovieTheater Club application project, we embraced the value of simplicity in our approach. We strategically focused on the core functionalities that were essential for the applicationâ€™s success, deliberately avoiding over-complication of features. This mindset was reflected in our design choices, where we opted for a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation, and in our coding practices, where we aimed for clean, maintainable code. By breaking down complex tasks into manageable parts and prioritizing them based on their impact, we were able to maintain a clear focus and avoid getting sidetracked by less critical features. This simplicity in our approach not only made our work more efficient but also resulted in a more robust and user-centered product.
